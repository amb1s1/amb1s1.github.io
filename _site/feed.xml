The problem was that the deleted vrf was named ssdata and the new vrf was hrssdata.

I started to learn how to use python to create report or to grab information from devices(Not just cisco). My manager asked to create script to grab a group of switches running config and to save it on an spreadsheet. We have a lot of branches and each branches had two switches, so what I did was to have each branch on their own tab and in this tab the two switches will have their configs in two columns. So branch1 will be in tab named branch one and switch 1 config will be on tab branch1 on column A and Switch2 will be in branch1 column B. This was show to our client and they love it(Business side love spreadsheets). 
I will post the script here, but before I do this I want to be clear. I’m not a pro in programming, I just have 6 months learning how to program. If you decide to use it, please use it at your own risk. Please make sure to check everything you dont want me to put a backdoor on your network, lol. &lt;/p&gt;

It was hard, because it was a lot of work to do for each ticket, easy because that’s what I do for a living and fun because I love troubleshooting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you passed the Route and Switch test your are basically ready for the TSHOOT, but there are still things that you need to be prepare 
I have couple of tips for this test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recreate the TSHOOT topology over, over and over to get used to the IP scheme and the entire topology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study all my TSHOOT notes from this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the TSHOOT Bull eye Strategy on youtube &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bo4Pw82G2M&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bo4Pw82G2M&lt;/a&gt; , this youtube video talk about how to tackle the test. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the first couple of chapter of the TSHOOT Cisco Press book where they talk Theories. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the TSHOOT CBT Nugget 
Again, I love this the TSHOOT exam and with a lot of effort and love to the technology you will pass this test.  &lt;/li&gt;

Technologies:
HSRP:
Hot Standby Router Protocol - Created by Cisco
VRRP:
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol - Created by IETF - Standard work with multiple vendors
GLBP:
Created by Cisco
Issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client using the wrong gateway ip address - ipconfig for pc and ifconfig for mac&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrong device acting as the active device - sh standby brief - The device that we want to be active has to have a higher priority number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missmatch authentication - sh run [interface]
 NOTE: Make sure that if a key-chain is on the interface, that the key-chain was created on the global config.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Active device doesn’t gain the Active after reboots - sh standby brief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrong group number - sh standby brief
Good Show command to know:
show standby brief - harp 
show glbp brief - glbp
 show vrrp brief - vrrp
show standby [interface] - hsrp
show glbp [interface] - glbp
show vrrp [interface] - vrrp
Debug standby terse - hsrp
Debug glbp terse - glbp
Debug vrrp event - vrrp

note: This is only redundancy protocol troubleshooting. You still need to know the other technologies to be able to fix any issues with redundancy protocol. Example, if layer 1 is not working HSRP, VRRP or GLBP are not going to work.&lt;/li&gt;

Issues Peering your neighbor router&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since TTL for EBGP is 1 (IBGP is 255) if you want peer to a router that is not one hop away, you will need to use the Multihop command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access List blocking TCP 179 - sh access-list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routers have to have ip reachability (Rip, EIGRP, Static Route….) if the   router   is not directly connect to be able to establish peering - sh ip route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGP peers must agree on the following attribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peer Address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unique RID (Router ID - loop interface)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ASN (autonomous system number)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important command to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;show ip bgp neighbors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;show ip route&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;show ip bgp summary&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      
 It took me more than I expect to complete this project the reason why, was that we were celebrating my daughter’s first birthday and bautism last sunday and I had to do a lot over the weekend. 
Beside that, I was running into some problems with GNS3. My co-worker and I came with the conclusion that it was a GNS3 bug, where it was showing the interface up/ up even though the cable was not plug in. I re-did the project and use the same config and everything was working.  
What I want to do is; I would be posting project with broken configs to have people practice troubleshooting by trying to fix the issues. I think this would be a great experience for my you guys and for me. Also I encourage people to send me broken projects to tshoot@gomezd.com and type on your subject: “Broken Project”. If you don’t type that in the subject the Spam will block the email. Also if you have any question feel free to leave the answer under comments. 
 So here we going
Click Here For the ZIP File
that includes: the .net file, Config Folder and working folder. When prompt for an username and password, type cisco for everything.
There is only one thing that has to be changed on the .net file and it is the image path for the Cisco IOS File, and it has to be changed in two lines. If you have a text editor that you can see the line number, the lines that have to be changed are lines 6 and 145.
I also did not include the IOS File since is not legal to do that, but I think you all know where to find it. About the IOS Version lets everybody stay with the same IOS version in this case is “c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.bin”. 
For Last, if anybody wants to add any technology to this project feel free to send me an email at the same email with the same subject and I will review and if it is appropriate, I will add to the project.
Thank and I hope you enjoy and lets start troubleshoot the heck out this lab. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">          TSHOOT GNS3 Complete Project with complete Configs</summary></entry></feed>
