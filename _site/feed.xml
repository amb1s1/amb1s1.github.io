Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

I would like to share this, so others network engineer can see how easy is to automate your daily work with python. 
Remember always test on a lab environment and use it if you understand. This is a really early version if any bug please feel free to tell me.

This is an option that I think most of the Engineers rarely use.
Example of when this was use to me:
I needed to confirm that all configuration for a specific vrf were remove. The problem was that the delete vrf was named ssdata and the new vrf was hrssdata. So when I search with a regular pipe:
show run | in ssdata 
I was getting command for hrssdata. I looked online and the solution was using regular expression, so I used the following:
show run | in &lt;em&gt;ssdata&lt;/em&gt;

I started to learn how to use python to create report or to grab information from devices(Not just cisco). My manager asked to create script to grab a group of switches running config and to save it on an spreadsheet. We have a lot of branches and each branches had two switches, so what I did was to have each branch on their own tab and in this tab the two switches will have their configs in two columns. So branch1 will be in tab named branch one and switch 1 config will be on tab branch1 on column A and Switch2 will be in branch1 column B. This was show to our client and they love it(Business side love spreadsheets). 
I will post the script here, but before I do this I want to be clear. I’m not a pro in programming, I just have 6 months learning how to program. If you decide to use it, please use it at your own risk. Please make sure to check everything you dont want me to put a backdoor on your network, lol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my code:
https://gist.github.com/amb1s1/5d29b155acd58f2874f2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format on my blog messed around with the script. Python is very tricky about space, so I uploaded my code to github with the rest of the files for this script to work.

It was hard, because it was a lot of work to do for each ticket, easy because that’s what I do for a living and fun because I love troubleshooting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you passed the Route and Switch test your are basically ready for the TSHOOT, but there are still things that you need to be prepare 
I have couple of tips for this test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recreate the TSHOOT topology over, over and over to get used to the IP scheme and the entire topology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study all my TSHOOT notes from this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the TSHOOT Bull eye Strategy on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bo4Pw82G2M , this youtube video talk about how to tackle the test. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the first couple of chapter of the TSHOOT Cisco Press book where they talk Theories. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the TSHOOT CBT Nugget 
Again, I love this the TSHOOT exam and with a lot of effort and love to the technology you will pass this test.  &lt;/li&gt;

Technologies:
HSRP:
Hot Standby Router Protocol - Created by Cisco
VRRP:
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol - Created by IETF - Standard work with multiple vendors
GLBP:
Created by Cisco
Issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client using the wrong gateway ip address - ipconfig for pc and ifconfig for mac&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrong device acting as the active device - sh standby brief - The device that we want to be active has to have a higher priority number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missmatch authentication - sh run [interface]
 NOTE: Make sure that if a key-chain is on the interface, that the key-chain was created on the global config.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Active device doesn’t gain the Active after reboots - sh standby brief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrong group number - sh standby brief
Good Show command to know:
show standby brief - harp 
show glbp brief - glbp
 show vrrp brief - vrrp
show standby [interface] - hsrp
show glbp [interface] - glbp
show vrrp [interface] - vrrp
Debug standby terse - hsrp
Debug glbp terse - glbp
Debug vrrp event - vrrp
sh run interface [interface]
note: This is only redundancy protocol troubleshooting. You still need to know the other technologies to be able to fix any issues with redundancy protocol. Example, if layer 1 is not working HSRP, VRRP or GLBP are not going to work.&lt;/li&gt;
