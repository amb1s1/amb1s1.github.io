      <p>          TSHOOT GNS3 Complete Project with complete Configs</p>

<p>      
 It took me more than I expect to complete this project the reason why, was that we were celebrating my daughter’s first birthday and bautism last sunday and I had to do a lot over the weekend. 
Beside that, I was running into some problems with GNS3. My co-worker and I came with the conclusion that it was a GNS3 bug, where it was showing the interface up/ up even though the cable was not plug in. I re-did the project and use the same config and everything was working.  
What I want to do is; I would be posting project with broken configs to have people practice troubleshooting by trying to fix the issues. I think this would be a great experience for my you guys and for me. Also I encourage people to send me broken projects to tshoot@gomezd.com and type on your subject: “Broken Project”. If you don’t type that in the subject the Spam will block the email. Also if you have any question feel free to leave the answer under comments. 
 So here we going
Click Here For the ZIP File
that includes: the .net file, Config Folder and working folder. When prompt for an username and password, type cisco for everything.
There is only one thing that has to be changed on the .net file and it is the image path for the Cisco IOS File, and it has to be changed in two lines. If you have a text editor that you can see the line number, the lines that have to be changed are lines 6 and 145.
I also did not include the IOS File since is not legal to do that, but I think you all know where to find it. About the IOS Version lets everybody stay with the same IOS version in this case is “c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.bin”. 
For Last, if anybody wants to add any technology to this project feel free to send me an email at the same email with the same subject and I will review and if it is appropriate, I will add to the project.
Thank and I hope you enjoy and lets start troubleshoot the heck out this lab. </p>
