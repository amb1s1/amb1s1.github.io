TSHOOT GNS3 Lab .net fileTo be able to load this file to GNS3 on your computer you are going to need to edit the following on the toot.net file:
The working Directory
current - workindir = shoot_working
*you have to edit this line with your working directory name.
The Image Path
current - image = /Users/gns3/Documents/Cisco IOS/c1700-k9o3sy7-mz.124-12c.bin
*you have to edit this line with your Cisco IOS image path
Also you have to change the model and chase with your device model and chassis. 
I will be downloading the base config file in the following days. Thanks
