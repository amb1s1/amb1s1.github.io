I started working on a python module to make it easy to ssh to cisco devices. I have been so busy at my job that when a script is requested, I just copy and paste the code to be able to ssh, but I decided to make a module for easy to use and to be more organize. I would like to share this, so others network engineer can see how easy is to automate your daily work with python. 
Remember always test on a lab environment and use it if you understand. This is a really early version if any bug please feel free to tell me.  

#### Here is the code:
