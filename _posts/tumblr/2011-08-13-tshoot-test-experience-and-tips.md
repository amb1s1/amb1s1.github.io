My experience with the TSHOOT test was hard, easy and fun. It was hard, because it was a lot of work to do for each ticket, easy because that’s what I do for a living and fun because I love troubleshooting. 

If you passed the Route and Switch test your are basically ready for the TSHOOT, but there are still things that you need to be prepare 
I have couple of tips for this test
1. Recreate the TSHOOT topology over, over and over to get used to the IP scheme and the entire topology.
2. Study all my TSHOOT notes from this blog.
3. Watch the TSHOOT Bull eye Strategy on youtube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bo4Pw82G2M> , this youtube video talk about how to tackle the test. 
4. Read the first couple of chapter of the TSHOOT Cisco Press book where they talk Theories. 
5. Watch the TSHOOT CBT Nugget 
Again, I love this the TSHOOT exam and with a lot of effort and love to the technology you will pass this test.
